        <p>The WKND is a fictional online magazine and adventure company that focuses
          on outdoor activities and trips across the globe. The WKND site is designed 
          to demonstrate functionality for Adobe Experience Manager. There is also a 
          corresponding tutorial that walks a developer through the development.  
          Special thanks to Lorenzo Buosi and Kilian Amendola who created the 
          beautiful design for the WKND site. Test2
